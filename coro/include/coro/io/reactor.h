// native_reactor -- readiness waiting for file descriptors, backed by
// the platform's multiplexer: kqueue on macOS/BSD, epoll on Linux.
//
// The shape of the thing: one background thread owns the kernel queue
// and does all the blocking. A coroutine that co_awaits wait() or
// sleep() parks a small request (which lives in its own frame), the
// reactor thread arms ONESHOT kernel events for it, and when an event
// fires the parked coroutine is resumed -- inline, on the reactor
// thread -- with a wait_status. Nothing polls, nothing spins: the
// reactor thread sleeps in kevent/epoll_wait until the kernel speaks.
//
// Tear down only when nothing is parked. Destruction does resume
// stragglers with wait_status::cancelled as a last resort, but a
// coroutine resumed that way must not touch the reactor again.
//
// One waiter per descriptor per direction at a time: registrations are
// keyed by (fd, filter), so a second read wait on an fd that already
// has one replaces it in the kernel and the first never completes. A
// read wait and a write wait on the same fd are fine, and each
// completes without disturbing the other.
